# Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

- The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions with 31 features.
- Features `V1`–`V28` are PCA-transformed for privacy, while `Time` and `Amount` remain interpretable.
- The target column is `Class` (0 = non-fraud, 1 = fraud).

Due to Kaggle’s terms of use, the raw data is **not** included in this repository.  
Please download it directly from Kaggle if you want to reproduce the results.
